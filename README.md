# MS v111

**DISCLAIMER:** Not affiliated with Nexon/Wizet in any way and no infringement intended. Just trying to keep an old version of a fun game alive.

Easier deployment for v111 server emulator based on [this version of the LithiumREV96 source](https://github.com/v3921358/LithiumREV96).

## To-Do

- Docker container to build Java server application.

  - Add to Docker compose file.

- Custom environment properties/parameters (server configs, rates, etc.) with Docker Compose, so no direct changes to app code need.
